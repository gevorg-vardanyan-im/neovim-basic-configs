# NeoVim

This is my basic neovim settings with mappings and options.

#### IMPORTANT
First install neovim and related packages by running setup script:
```
$ bash setup.sh
```

Next clone this repo directly to the neovim config path:
```
git clone https://notabug.org/GevorgVardanyan/neovim-basic-configs.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Additionally check health of nvim:
```
:checkhealth
```
